It operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions are made directly between users without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology to record all transactions made with the currency. The blockchain is a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers, known as nodes. When a transaction is made, it is verified by these nodes and added to the blockchain, ensuring that all transactions are secure and transparent.\n\nOne of the key features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, which helps to prevent inflation and maintain the value of the currency. Bitcoins can be bought, sold, and traded on various online exchanges, and they can also be used to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept",

However, Ethereum's blockchain is more advanced in that it can execute complex scripts known as smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These smart contracts can automate various processes, such as payments, asset exchanges, and identity verification, without the need for intermediaries.\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, used to pay for transactions and computational services. It also serves as a store of value and can be traded on various exchanges like other cryptocurrencie",
